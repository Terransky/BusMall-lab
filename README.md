# BusMall-lab

BusMall, a poor man's SkyMall, wanted a way to survey customer's preferences through a website clicking app. 3 images are shown, never the same, and never subsequently, for a total of 25 rounds upon which a chart shows the tally. Using local storage we are able to add persistence to the votes (for that browser, at least).
